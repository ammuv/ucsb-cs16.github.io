# Some options

* Simple terminal based editors on CSIL:
   * [`vim`](/topics/vim/)
   * [`emacs`](/topics/emacs/)
* Simple graphical editors on CSIL:
   * [`atom`](/topics/atom/)
   * [`code`](/topics/vscode/) Visual Studio Code (`code` command on CSIL, also known as "vscode")

# Our advice

* Learn at least "survival vim"
   * You'll need that skill for working with cloud systems, backend systems, in situations
     where you only have a command line, and not a graphical environment.
   * You don't necessarily need to be able to do sophisticated editing, but you should be able
     to do the basics: entering code, copy/paste, search/replace, show line numbers,
     save as, and include code from another file.
* Learn either atom or vscode
   * These provide helpful editing capabilities that are sensitive to your particular
     programming language including auto-completion, early detection of syntax errors,
     integration with version control, and many more features that you'll come to appreciate
     as you progress as a programmer.
