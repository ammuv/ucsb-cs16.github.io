During the 2022-2023 school year, UCSB is migrating to Canvas as it's 
Course Management System (CMS).  By Fall 2023, support for the prior CMS,
Gauchospace, will be dropped.

A key benefit of Canvas is the ability to have a secure centralized gradebook, i.e. one where:

* Instructors, TAs and readers have read/write access to all grades
* Students have read only access to only their own grade

Other benefits:

* Adding/dropping is automatic, and synchronized with course enrollment
* All students and faculty already have a username/password (their existing UCSBNetID).

A consideration whenusing Canvas for actual curriculum *content*  (e.g. content of lectures, labs, homework and programming
assignments) is that typically only students enrolled in the course can see that content.   This can make sharing curriculum resources more cumbersome.
